Description:

  Retrieve static simulation files for IPs from the current project or the Xilinx IP catalog and setup
  source library for compile_simlib. The compile_simlib tcl task will use this library for compiling the
  IP files for the specified simulator.

Arguments:

  -directory - (Optional) Directory path to the static library. By default, if this switch is not specified
               then this command will build the library in the directory named "static_compiled_lib" in the
               current working directory. 

  -project   - (Optional) Extract and prepare static source library for the current project

  -install   - (Optional) Extract and prepare static source library for the IP catalog

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, ignoring any command line errors and returning no
  messages. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors encountered during execution.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following command will build static library for all the IPs in the current project in ./static_compiled_lib,

  % setup_ip_static_library -project

  The following command will build static library in /work/simlib. The command will create the /work/simlib directory,
  if it does not exist.

  % setup_ip_static_library -directory /work/simlib -project
