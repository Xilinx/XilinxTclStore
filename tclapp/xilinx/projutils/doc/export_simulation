Description:

  Export a simulation script file for the target simulator. The generated script will
  contain simulator commands for compiling, elaborating and simulating the design.

  The command will retrieve the simulation compile order for the specified object
  and export this information in a text file with the compiler commands and default
  options for the target simulator. The specified object can be either a simulation
  fileset or an IP. If the object is not specified, then this command will generate
  the script for the simulation top. Any verilog include directories or file paths
  for the files containing verilog define statements will be added to the compiler
  command line.

  The command will also copy data files (if any) from the fileset or an IP to the
  output directory. If the design contains "Verilog" sources, then the "glbl.v" file
  will also be copied from the software installation path to the output directory.

  By default, the file paths for the design sources and include directories will be
  set absolute but these file paths can also made "relative" wrt to a specified location.

  In order to perform simulation with the generated script, the simulation libraries
  must be compiled first, with the compiled library directory path specified, when
  generating this script.

Arguments:

  -of_objects - (Optional) Specify the target object for which the simulation script
  file needs to be generated. The target object can be either a simulation fileset
  (simset) or an IP. If this option is not specified then this command will generate 
  file for the current simulation fileset "top".
  
  -relative_to - (Optional) Specify the directory path wrt which the project sources
  and include directories will be made "relative to" in the generated script file.

  -compiled_lib_path - (Optional) Specify the pre-compiled simulation library directory
  path where the Xilinx simulation libraries are compiled. This command will copy the
  required setup files from this directory to the output directory, create sub-directories
  for the design libraries and update the library mappings.

  NOTE: If this option is not specified then please follow the instructions in the
  generated script header for updating the library mappings.

  -32bit - (Optional) Specify this option to perform 32bit simulation. If this option
  is not specified then by default 64bit option will be added to the command line.

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite an existing script file of the same name. If
  the script file already exists, the tool returns an error unless the -force argument
  is specified. 

  -simulator - (Required) Specify the simulator name for which the simulation script
   needs to be generated. The valid simulators are "ies" and "vcs_mx".

  -dir - (Required) Specify the directory path where the simulation files will be exported.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, ignoring any command line errors and
  returning no messages. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors encountered
  during execution.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return all messages
  from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following command generates a simulation script file in the current directory for
  the "IES" simulator:-

  % export_simulation -simulator ies -dir "."

  The following command overwrites an existing script file in the current directory:-

  % export_simulation -force -simulator ies -dir "."

  The following command generates a script file named "top_tb_sim_ies.txt" in the
  "./test_sim" directory for a project with simulation top set to "top_tb". The command
  will also copy any data files (.mif, .coe, .dat, etc) to the ./test_sim directory:-

  % export_simulation -simulator ies -dir "./test_sim"

  The following command generates a script file "top_tb_sim_vcs_mx.txt" for the
  "VCS_MX" simulator in the specified output directory with the design source file paths
  in the script file set relative to the "/tmp/project" directory:-

  % export_simulation -relative_to "/tmp/project" -force -simulator vcs_mx -dir "test_sim"

  The following command generates a script file "accum_0_sim_ies.txt" for the "accum_0" IP
  in the specified output directory for the "IES" simulator:-

  % export_simulation -of_objects [get_files accum_0.xci] -simulator ies -dir "test_sim"

  The following command generates a script file "accum_0_sim_vcs_mx.txt" for the
  "accum_0" IP in the specified output directory for the "VCS_MX" simulator:-

  % export_simulation -of_objects [get_ips accum_0] -simulator vcs_mx -dir "test_sim"

  The following command generates a script file "fifo_tb_sim_vcs_mx.txt" for the simulation
  fileset "sim_fifo_test" whose top is set to "fifo_tb" in the specified output directory
  for the "IES" simulator:-

  % export_simulation -of_objects [get_filesets sim_fifo_test] -simulator ies -dir "test_sim"

  The following command copies the required setup file(s) from the pre-compiled simulation
  library location "/tmp/sim_libs/ies/lib" to the specified output directory, creates the
  sub-directories for the design libraries and update the library mappings in the copied
  setup files:-

  % export_simulation -compiled_lib_path "/tmp/sim_libs/ies/lib" -simulator ies -dir "test_sim"

  The following command exports a script file "top_tb_sim_vcs_mx.txt" for the "VCS_MX" simulator
  in the specified output directory with the design source files compiled for 32 bit version of
  the simulator compiler (no 64 bit option will be added to the command line):-

  % export_simulation -force -32bit -simulator vcs_mx -dir "test_bft_vcs_mx"
