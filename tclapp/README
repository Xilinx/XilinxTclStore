Tcl App directory

This directory is the top-level directory for all Vivaod Tcl Apps.

Apps are organized by providers, where a provider is a company.
Under the provider directory apps are contained within individual
directories.

XilinxTclStore/
  tclapp/
    xilinx/
      utils/   # utils app from Xilinx
        tcl files # all tcl sources for utils
        test/  # testing directory
          test.tcl # test script to run under Vivado for utils
    mycompany/
      myapp/   # some app from mycompany
        tcl files # all tcl files for myapp
        test/  # testing directory
          test.tcl # test script to run under Vivado for myapp
          test.info

The 'mycompany' provider is included as an example, please see 
README files in the various directories under this provider for
instructions on how to add new apps.


TESTING
Each testing directory has test.tcl where other test scripts can be sourced. 
e.g. If myapp has two tests, one is test1.tcl and the other is test2.tcl, then test.tcl contains:
>cat test.tcl
source test1.tcl
source test2.tcl
>
