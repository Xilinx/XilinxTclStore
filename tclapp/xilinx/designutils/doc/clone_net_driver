  Description: 

     Clone the driver cell of a net.

     This command should be preferably run on a synthesized design.

  Example:
  
    The following example clone the driver of the net and returns the cloned cell:
     set clone [::xilinx::designutils::clone_net_driver ingressLoop[0].ingressFifo/reset_IBUF ]

    The following example add a suffix to the cloned driver name:
     set clone [::xilinx::designutils::clone_net_driver ingressLoop[0].ingressFifo/reset_IBUF {_clone}]
