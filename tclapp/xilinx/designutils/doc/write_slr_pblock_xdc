
  Description:

     Writes XDC specific pblock constraints based on the current design placement
     for each SLR.  The XDC file can be exported from the top-level or from a
     specific hierarchical cell.

  Example:

    The following example creates an XDC file which contains SLR specific
    pblock constraints for each of the cells under the current level of hierarchy.
