 Description: 
  Build the FPGA Ethernet server application using SDK according 
  to the project configuration parameters
 [WORKING DIRECTORY]/doc/project_name/ip_configuration_parameters.txt
  and program the FPGA.
  
 An evaluation board connected to an host computer through an Ethernet and USB JTAG cable is required.
 
 This command can be run after 'ip_prototype_build' command only.

 Example:
  ip_prototype_load -project_name my_project0  -board_name zedboard -type_eth udp
  ip_prototype_load -project_name my_project0  -board_name zedboard -type_eth udp -mem_base_address 33554432
