Description:

  Export IP user files repository with static, dynamic, netlist, verilog/vhdl stubs and memory initializaton files.

Arguments:

  -of_objects - (Optional) Specify the target object for which the IP static and dynamic files needs to be exported.

  -ip_user_files_dir - (Optional) Directory path to IP user files base directory (for dynamic and other IP non static files).
                     By default, if this switch is not specified then this command will use the path specified with the
                     "IP.USER_FILES_DIR" project property value.

  -ipstatic_source_dir - (Optional)  Directory path to the static IP files
                     By default, if this switch is not specified then this command will use the path specified with the
                     "SIM.IPSTATIC_SOURCE_DIR" project property value.

  NOTE:- If the -ip_user_files_dir switch is specified, by default the IP static files will be exported under the sub-directory
         with the name "ipstatic". If this switch is specified in conjunction with -ipstatic_source_dir, then the IP static
         files will be exported in the path specified with the -ipstatic_source_dir switch. 

  -clean_dir - (Optional) Delete all files from central directory (including static, dynamic and other files)

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, ignoring any command line errors and returning no
  messages. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors encountered during execution.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following command will export,

   'char_fifo' IP dynamic files to '<project>/<project>.ip_user_files/ip/char_fifo' directory
   'char_fifo' IP static files to '<project>/<project>.ip_user_files/ipstatic' directory

  % export_ip_user_files -of_objects [get_ips char_fifo]
