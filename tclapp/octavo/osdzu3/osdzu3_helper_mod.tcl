#
# The "osdzu3_helper.tcl" file performs the following functions:
#
#    1. Maps the top-level port name to the SiP pin location.
#
#    2. Modifies the input/output delays to add the SiP pin flight times so that they
#        are properly accounted for during Static Timing Analysis
#
# The "osdzu3_helper.tcl" file must be source by Vivado before the functions can be 
# used.  There are two options:
#
#    1. Add the following command to our Vivado_init.tcl file where <path> is the 
#        directory path to the file.
#
#        source <path>/osdzu3_helper.tcl
#
#    2. Add the osdzu3_helper.tcl fie to the Vivado project's constraint set.  In the
#       constraint set, the osdzu3_helper.tcl file must be listed before any file
#       containing one of the functions defined in the osdzu3_helper.tcl.

# Usage: pin mapping CSV should be copied inside the body of proc osdzu3_xilinx_mapping.
#        Commented-out lines are valid and should start with character '#'
#        CSV separator character: ,

# Command to set package pin:
#  set_osdzu3_package_pin <OSDZU3_Package_Pin> <topLevelPort>
# E.g:
#  set_osdzu3_package_pin AD21 myport

# ASSUMPTION: package pin have been set prior from settting the input/output delays

# Command to set min/max input delay:
#  set_osdzu3_input_delay <COMMAND_LINE_FOR_SET_INPUT_DELAY>
# E.g:
#  set_osdzu3_input_delay -clock clk 0.3 [get_ports in*]
#  set_osdzu3_input_delay -min -clock clk 0.1 [get_ports in*]

# Command to set min/max output delay:
#  set_osdzu3_output_delay <COMMAND_LINE_FOR_SET_OUTPUT_DELAY>
# E.g:
#  set_osdzu3_output_delay -min -clock clk 0.1 [get_ports out*]
#  set_osdzu3_output_delay -max -clock clk 0.4 [get_ports out*]

  #          The "set_property PACKAGE_PIN" constraint will be substituted with "set_osdzu3_package_pin", the Xilinx package

    Description: Export Octavo custom constraint files

       This command exports two or three constraint files from the loaded implemented design 
       using the write_xdc command. The "set_property PACKAGE_PIN" constraint will be subsituted 
       with "set_osdzu3_package_pin", the Xilinx package pin subsituted with the OSDZU3 SiP 
       package pin and saved in the file "osdzu3_package_pins.tcl". The "set_input_delay" and 
       "set_output_delay" constraint will be subsituted with "set_osdzu3_input_delay" and 
       "set_osdzu3_output_delay", saved in the file "osdzu3_io_delay.tcl". The input/output 
       delays will be adjusted to add the SiP pin flight times so that they are properly accounted 
       for during Static Timing Analysis. All other constraints will be exported to the 
       file "osdzu3_timing.xdc".
