Description:

  Export a simulation script file for the target simulator (please see the list of supported
  simulators below). The generated script will contain simulator commands for compiling, 
  elaborating and simulating the design.

  The command will retrieve the simulation compile order of specified objects, and export
  this information in a shell script with the compiler commands and default options for the
  target simulator. The specified object can be either a simulation fileset or an IP.

  If the object is not specified, then this command will generate the script for the active
  simulation "top". Any verilog include directories or file paths for the files containing 
  verilog define statements will be added to the compiler command line.

  By default, the design source file and include directory paths in the compiler command line
  will be set relative to the "reference_dir" variable that is set in the generated script.
  To make these paths absolute, specify the "-absolute_path" switch.

  The command will also copy data files (if any) from the fileset, or from an IP, to the output
  directory. If the design contains "Verilog" sources, then the generated script will also copy
  the "glbl.v" file from the software installation path to the output directory.

  A default ".do" file that is used in the compiler commands in the simulation script for the
  target simulator, will be written to the output directory.

  NOTE: In order to perform simulation with the generated script, the simulation libraries must
  be compiled first using the 'compile_simlib' Tcl command with the compiled library directory
  path specified, when generating this script. The generated script will automatically include
  the setup files for the target simulator from the compiled library directory.

  Supported simulators:-

    Vivado Simulator (xsim)
    ModelSim Simulator (modelsim) 
    Questa Advanced Simulator (questa)
    Incisive Enterprise Simulator (ies)
    Verilog Compiler Simulator (vcs)

Arguments:

  -of_objects - (Optional) Specify the target object for which the simulation script file needs
  to be generated. The target object can be either a simulation fileset (simset) or an IP. If this
  option is not specified then this command will generate file for the current simulation fileset. 
  
  -lib_map_path - (Optional) Specify the pre-compiled simulation library directory path where the
  Xilinx simulation libraries are compiled. Please see the header section in the generated script
  for more information.

  -script_name - (Optional) Specify the name of the shell script. If this option is not specified
  then the filename with the following syntax will be generated based on the object type selected
  with -of_objects switch:

   <simulation_top_name>_sim_<simulator>.sh
   <ip_name>_sim_<simulator>.sh

  -absolute_path - (Optional) Specify this option to make source and include directory paths used
  in the script "absolute". By default, all paths are written as "relative" to the directory path
  that is specified with the -directory switch. A "reference_dir" variable will be set in the 
  script to the directory path that is specified with the -directory switch.

  -32bit - (Optional) Specify this option to perform 32bit simulation. If this option is not
  specified then by default 64bit option will be added to the simulation command line.

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite an existing script file of the same name. If the script file already
  exists, the tool returns an error unless the -force argument is specified. 

  -directory - (Required) Specify the directory path where the script file will be exported.

  -simulator - (Required) Specify the target simulator name for the simulation script. The valid
  simulators names are "xsim" "modelsim" "questa" "ies" "vcs" (or "vcs_mx") "riviera" and "activehdl".

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, ignoring any command line errors and returning no
  messages. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors encountered during execution.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

Examples:

  The following command generates a simulation script file in the current directory for the "IES"
  simulator. The source file paths in the generated script will be set relative to the current directory:

  % export_simulation -directory "." -simulator ies

  The following command generates a simulation script file in the current directory for the "IES"
  simulator. The source file paths in the generated script will be set absolute:

  % export_simulation -absolute_path -directory "." -simulator ies

  The following command overwrites an existing script file in the current directory:

  % export_simulation -force -directory "." -simulator ies

  The following command generates a simulation script file named "test_ies.sh" in the "./test_sim"
  directory:

  % export_simulation -directory "./test_sim" -simulator ies -script_name test_ies.sh

  The following command generates a script file named "top_tb_sim_ies.sh" in the "./test_sim" directory
  for a project with simulation top set to "top_tb". The command will also copy any data files (.mif,
  .coe, .dat, etc) to the ./test_sim directory:

  % export_simulation -directory "./test_sim" -simulator ies

  The following command generates a script file "accum_0_sim_ies.sh" for the "accum_0" IP in the
  specified output directory for the "IES" simulator:

  % export_simulation -of_objects [get_files accum_0.xci] -directory "test_sim" -simulator ies

  The following command generates a script file "accum_0_sim_vcs_mx.sh" for the "accum_0" IP in the
  specified output directory for the "VCS_MX" simulator:

  % export_simulation -of_objects [get_ips accum_0] -directory "test_sim" -simulator vcs_mx

  The following command generates a script file "fifo_tb_sim_vcs_mx.sh" for the simulation fileset
  "sim_fifo_test" whose top is set to "fifo_tb" in the specified output directory for the "IES" simulator:

  % export_simulation -of_objects [get_filesets sim_fifo_test] -directory "test_sim" -simulator ies

  The following command exports a script file "top_tb_sim_vcs_mx.sh" for the "VCS_MX" simulator in the
  specified output directory with the design source files compiled for 32 bit version of the simulator
  compiler (no 64 bit option will be added to the command line):

  % export_simulation -force -32bit -directory "test_bft_vcs_mx" -simulator vcs_mx

  The following command will include "/sim_libs/ius/lin64/lib/cds.lib" file path in the "./test_sim/cds.lib"
  file ("INCLUDE /sim_libs/ius/lin64/lib/cds.lib") for referencing the compiled libraries for "IES" simulator:-

  % export_simulation -lib_map_path "/sim_libs/ius/lin64/lib" -directory "test_sim" -simulator ies

  The following command will include "/sim_libs/vcs/lin64/lib/synopsys_sim.setup" file path in the
  "./test_sim/synopsys_sim.setup" file ("OTHERS=/sim_libs/vcs/lin64/lib/synopsys_sim.setup") for referencing
  the compiled libraries for the "VCS_MX" simulator:-

  % export_simulation -lib_map_path "/sim_libs/vcs/lin64/lib" -directory "test_sim" -simulator vcs_mx

  The following steps generates a script file in "./test_sim/ies" directory and then compile, elaborate
  and simulate the design in "IES" simulator:-

  % export_simulation -lib_map_path "/sim_libs/ies/lin64/lib" -directory "./test_sim/ies" -simulator ies
  % cd test_sim/ies
  % ./top_tb_sim_ies.sh

  The following steps generates a script file in "./test_sim/vcs_mx" directory and then compile, elaborate
  and simulate the design in "VCS_MX" simulator:-

  % export_simulation -lib_map_path "/sim_libs/vcs/lin64/lib" -directory "./test_sim/vcs_mx" -simulator vcs_mx
  % cd test_sim/vcs_mx
  % ./top_tb_sim_vcs_mx.sh
