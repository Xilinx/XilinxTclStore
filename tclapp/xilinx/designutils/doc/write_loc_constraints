Description:

  Writes LOC constraints to a Xilinx Design Constraints file (XDC). The XDC
  can be exported from the top-level, or from a specific hierarchical cell.

Example:

  The following example creates an XDC file which contains the fixed placement
  cells in the open design.

    write_loc_constraints -file fixed_only.xdc

  The following example creates an XDC file which contains the all the placed
  cells (fixed and non-fixed) in the open design for the specified primitive
  groups BMEM (BlockRAMs) and MULT (DSPs).

  NOTE: The primitive group is specific to the device architecture. For this
        example, the primitive groups are intended for the 7 Series architecture.

    write_loc_constraints -file my_locs.xdc -all_placement -primitive_group BMEM \
      -primitive_group MULT

  The following example creates an XDC file which contains the all the placement
  information from the given cell list including the SLICE BEL locations.

    write_loc_constraints -file my_sub_locs.xdc -all_placement \
      -include_bels -of_objects [get_cells my_sub/*]
