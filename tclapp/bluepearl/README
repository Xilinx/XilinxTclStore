MyCompany Tcl Apps (demonstration)

This directory is the top-level directory for Tcl Apps provided
by MyCompany.

The only Tcl file within this directory is a manually copied
pkgIndex.tcl file.  The file pkgIndex.tcl is the same in all
provider directories.

================================================================
CREATING A NEW TCL APP
================================================================
To create a new Tcl App simply make a new directory with the 
name of the App, e.g.

% mkdir myapp

In the app directory you can add any number of Tcl files that 
together make up the app. The only requirement is that the app
directory contains one Tcl file with the same name as the app, 
e.g. myapp.tcl with at least this content

% cat myapp/myapp.tcl
################################################################
namespace eval ::tclapp::mycompany::myapp {

    # Allow Tcl to find tclIndex
    variable home [file join [pwd] [file dirname [info script]]]
    if {[lsearch -exact $::auto_path $home] == -1} {
	lappend ::auto_path $home
    }

}
package provide ::tclapp::mycompany::myapp 1.0
################################################################

No other files in myapp/ should use the 'package provide' command.

Now follow the directions in the myapp/README file.
