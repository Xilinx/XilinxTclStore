  Description: 

     Generates GT reference clock summary of block design.

     This command must be run on a gt_quad_base IP based IPI block design.

     If Quad reference clock frequencies are same in the generated summary file, user could optimize the reference clock inputs by shorting them.

  Example:
  
    The following example generates GT reference clock summary of gt_quad base IP based , IPI block design:
     xilinx::designutils::report_gt_refclk_summary
