**Protoip** is a utility for quickly prototyping C-based IP in FPGA hardware.

Abstracting many specific low level FPGA design details, **protoip** shifts main focus to algorithm coding (C/C++ programming language), and boosts productivity.

**Protoip** provides tcl scripts, custom templates, examples and tutorials to support all design phases.

All documentation for **protoip** is available in the Wiki at https://github.com/asuardi/protoip/wiki/Home
