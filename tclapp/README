Tcl App directory

This directory is the top-level directory for all Vivado Tcl Apps.

Apps are organized by providers, where a provider is a company.
Under the provider directory apps are contained within individual
directories.

XilinxTclStore/
  tclapp/
    xilinx/
      utils/   # utils app from Xilinx
        tcl files # all tcl sources for utils
        test/  # testing directory
          test.tcl # test script to run under Vivado for utils
            doc/ # long help files, the name of the files have to be exactly same as the proc name
    mycompany/
      myapp/   # some app from mycompany
        tcl files # all tcl files for myapp
        test/  # testing directory
          test.tcl # test script to run under Vivado for myapp
          test.info
            doc/ # long help files, the name of the files have to be exactly same as the proc name


The 'mycompany' provider is included as an example, please see 
README files in the various directories under this provider for
instructions on how to add new apps.


TESTING
Each testing directory has test.tcl where other test scripts can be sourced. 
e.g. If myapp has two tests, one is test1.tcl and the other is test2.tcl, then test.tcl contains:
>cat test.tcl
set path [file normalize [file dirname [info script]]]
#puts "script is invoked from $path"
#source [file join $path {test1.tcl}]
#source [file join $path {test2.tcl}]
>

Tests should indicate a failure by executing the tcl error command, e.g.

error "My test detected a failure"

Tests should NOT modify any files in the git repo.

HELP 
Add the long help files into doc directory under the app
The name of the file has to be exactly same as the proc.
e.g. write_project_tcl is the command, so the help file will be named "write_project_tcl".

================================================================
ADDING A NEW PROVIDER
================================================================
1. Create a directory with provider name immediately under the tclapp
   directory

% mkdir <provider>
% cd provider

2. Copy the mycompany/pkgIndex.tcl to this directory, do *not* edit.
% cp mycompany/pkgIndex.tcl .

3. Follow the instructions in mycompany/README
