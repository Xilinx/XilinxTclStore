  Description: Write script to interface with Atrenta Spyglass

     A design in Vivado automatically picks up library files (verilog/ .libs) 
     based on the FPGA Architecture settings. 
     When the designer wants to analyse the design in an external tool,
     it is very difficult to know all the library files that should go with it.
     This script solves that problem by generating the SpyGlass configuration
     file from the Vivado setup for the design.
     Use the Configuration file (<design-top>.prj) to invoke SpyGlass and 
     perform design analysis for Lint/ CDC issues.
  
  Example:
     write_spyglass_script <design-top> <design-top>.prj
