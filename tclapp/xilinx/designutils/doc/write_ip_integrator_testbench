Description:

  Create a testbench for an IP Integrator design and optionally add it to the current project

Example:

  The following example creates a VHDL testbench based on the current_bd_design and adds it to the
  project:

    write_ip_integrator_testbench -addToProject

  This example creates a Verilog testbench based on the given input file and sets the output files
  path and name:

    write_ip_integrator_testbench -verilog -output \"c:/vipi/testbenches/tb_mydesign.v\" \"c:/vipi/sources/mydesign.v\"
