Description:
Convert a Vivado project to an ALINT-PRO format directly from Vivado IDE.

The ALINT-PRO project files are saved in the same location as the currently
opened Vivado project. To run ALINT-PRO conversion, please ensure that the
ALINT-PRO software and required licenses are available.

Optionally, ALINT-PRO can be started in GUI mode with the converted project
using the -gui flag.

Examples:

Convert the project by running ALINT-PRO in the batch mode and exiting:
  ::aldec::alint::convert_project <alint_path>

Convert the project by running ALINT-PRO in the GUI mode:
  ::aldec::alint::convert_project -gui <alint_path>
