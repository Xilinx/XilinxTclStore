  Description: 
  
     Insert a probe to connect an output leaf clock pin to an output port. The output should not exist and is created by the command

     The pin to be probed should be an output clock pin, typically a BUFG output pin.
     The probed pin is connected to the output port through an ODDR->OBUF circuitry.
     The output port is created by the command and cannot exist before. The ODDR and OBUF
     are created as well and instanciated at the top-level.
   
     If -diff_port is used instead of -port then a differential port is created and
     driven through a OBUFDS.
   
     It is recommended to use the command on an unplaced design.

  Example:
     ::xilinx::designutils::insert_clock_probe -pin bufg/O -port probe -iostandard HSTL
     ::xilinx::designutils::insert_clock_probe -pin bufg/O -diff_port probe -iostandard LVDS
