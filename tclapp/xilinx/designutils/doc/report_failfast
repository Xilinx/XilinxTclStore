  Description: 

     Generate a fail/pass report
     
     Use -export_config to export configuration file
     Use -config_file to import user configuration file
     Use -csv to generate a CSV format
     Use -transpose to transpose the CSV table and export it as 1-liner
     Use -detailed_reports to generate detailed reports for methdology checks, paths failing LUT/Net budgeting, the Non-FD HFN and Average Fanout
     Use -cell/-pblock to force the analysis on a specific module and pblock in a Partial Reconfigurable design. By default, the analysis is done from the top-level. The full hierarchical path must be specified for -cell
     Use -top to specify the top-level design
     Use -pblock for Pblock-based analysis (more info with -longhelp)
     Use -region for Clock Region-based analysis (more info with -longhelp)
     Use -slr for SLR-based analysis (more info with -longhelp)
     Use -by_slr to automatically run the analysis for each SLR
     Use -no_utilization to prevent extraction of the utilization metrics
     Use -no_methodology_check to prevent extraction of the TIMING-* metrics
     Use -no_fanout to prevent calculation of the average fanout
     Use -no_path_budgeting to prevent calculation of the LUT/Net budgeting
     Use -no_hfn to prevent calculation of Non-FD high fanout nets
     Use -no_dont_touch to prevent calculation of DONT_TOUCH metric
     Use -no_mark_debug to prevent calculation of MARK_DEBUG metric
     Use -no_control_sets to prevent extraction of control sets metric
     Use -ignore_pr to prevent auto detection of Partial Reconfigurable designs and always runs the analysis from top-level
     Use -show_resources to report the detailed number of used and available resources in the summary table
     Use -show_not_found to report metrics that have not been extracted (hidden by default)
     Use -show_all_paths to report all the paths analyzed in the LUT/Net budgeting. Default it to only report paths with budgeting violation
     Use -post_ooc_synth to only run the LUT/Net path budgeting after post OOC synthesis
     Use -hide_slacks to hide the setup slacks of the nets inside the DONT_TOUCH/MARK_DEBUG detailed reports
     Use -exclude_cell to exclude a hierarchical module from consideration. Only utilization metrics are reported
     Use -max_paths to set the max number of paths per clock group for LUT/Net budgeting. Default is 100
     Use -no_header to suppress the files header
     Use -only_fails to only report metrics that are failing and that need to be reviewed
     Use -custom_metrics/-no_custom_metrics/-only_custom_metrics to control user custom metrics
     Use -return_paths to return timing paths:
       none: no timing path is return (default)
       path_budgeting: return the paths that have net/lut budgeting violations
       lut_pair_missed: return the paths that missed at least one lut-pair placement (Versal)
       lut_pair_found: return the paths that have at least one lut-pair placement (Versal)
       lut_pair_candidate: return the paths that are candidate for one or more lut-pair placement (Versal)

     Use -longhelp for more information on the supported use models

     ::xilinx::designutils::report_failfast -file failfast.rpt -slr SLR0
     ::xilinx::designutils::report_failfast -file failfast.rpt -by_slr
     ::xilinx::designutils::report_failfast -file failfast.rpt -regions X0Y0:X0Y4,X0Y4:X5Y4,X5Y0 -top
     ::xilinx::designutils::report_failfast -file failfast.rpt -post_ooc_synth -show_all_paths
