  Description:
  
    Writes a Verilog Structural netlist from a timing report produced by the Vivado
    report_timing command. The Verilog and assocaited XDC file can be used in Vivado
    to simulate the path behavior from a larger design.

  Example:

    The following example creates a Verilog structural netlist using the -of_objects option and
    the get_timing_paths command for the three paths with the worst calculated slack.

      ::xilinx::designutils::timing_report_to_verilog -of_objects [get_timing_paths -max_paths 3]

    This next example creates a Verilog structural netlist based on the two timing paths
    with the worst calculated slack parsed directly from the timing report.

      ::xilinx::designutils::timing_report_to_verilog -filename xlnx_design -report_string [report_timing -input_pins -max_paths 2 -return_string]

    *NOTE* The report_timing string requires the -input_pins and -return_string switches for proper processing of the report.
