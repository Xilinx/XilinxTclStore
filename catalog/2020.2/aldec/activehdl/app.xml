      <summary>This is a Aldec Active-HDL Simulator integration app that implements the simulation flow in Vivado IDE to allow users to compile, elaborate and simulate a design. To simulate a design using this app, set the target simulator in the simulation settings to &apos;Active-HDL Simulator&apos; and then click on the &apos;Run Simulation&apos; button in the IDE to launch the simulation. You can also generate simulation scripts for the design in the &apos;scripts only&apos; mode in which case these self-contained generated scripts can be executed in the simulation run directory. The simulation can also be launched from the Tcl console using the launch_simulation command. The list of target simulators can be obtained by running get_simulators Tcl command. The simulation flow for this app requires that this simulator is installed with the license and Xilinx Simulation libraries compiled.</summary>
