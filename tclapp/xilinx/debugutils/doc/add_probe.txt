Readme about add_probe.tcl

to test add_probe function, please use Vivado 2014.4 

follow the steps below,

vivado% source ../test/test.tcl

it will open an fully routed checkpoint test.dcp first; then drag an internal signal inst_1/tmp_q[0] to port loc H10 as probe named myprobe1 and finish routing; after that, will replace signal inst_1/tmp_q[0] with another signal inst_1/tmp_q[1] and attach to the same probe port.

last, we need to verify if all the error/warning works well, 

please open ../test/test.tcl and execute last three line (commented out at .tcl) one by one at Vivado, Suppose all three will return Critical Warning message.
