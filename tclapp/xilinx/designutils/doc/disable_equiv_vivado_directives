  Decription:

     Disables equivalent directive settings for advanced flow, so that regular place_design command can be run.

     This command can be run just after place_design.

  Example:

     ::xilinx::designutils::enable_equiv_vivado_directives
     place_design -directive AltSpreadLogic_medium -verbose

     ::xilinx::designutils::disable_equiv_vivado_directives
