  Description: Write script to run Siemens Questa Design Solutions LINT tool.

     A design in Vivado automatically picks up library files based on 
     the FPGA Architecture settings. 
     When the designer wants to analyse the design in an external tool,
     it is very difficult to know all the library/setup files that should go with it.
     This script solves that problem by generating the Questa LINT setup and run
     files from the Vivado setup for the design.
     Use the shell script file (qlint_run.sh) to run Questa LINT for performing
     Clock Domain Crossing (LINT) analysis for the design.
  
  Example:
     write_questa_lint_script <design-top> [-output_directory <output_directory_name>]
